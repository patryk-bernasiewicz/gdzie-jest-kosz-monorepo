# gdzie-jest-kosz-dashboard

This is the admin dashboard for the Gdzie Jest Kosz mobile application. The dashboard is a web application for managing bins on a map, built with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router, and Clerk authentication (login only).

## Project Purpose

This dashboard supports the Gdzie Jest Kosz React Native app, which helps dog owners find nearby trash bins to dispose of their dog's poop. The dashboard allows admins and moderators to manage bin locations and related data.

## Intended Users

- Currently: Project owner (admin)
- Future: Moderators and admins with dashboard access

## Features

- Authentication via Clerk (login only, registration via the mobile app)
- Map view for managing bin locations
- Admin/moderator access controls

## Update DEV-0.0.1: Drag and Drop Bin Editing

You can now edit bin locations directly on the map by dragging markers. When editing a bin, simply drag the marker to a new position and release it to update the location. This feature improves the map editing experience and allows for more precise bin placement.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file with required environment variables (e.g., Clerk keys, API URLs)
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## API

- All API calls use the Axios instance from `src/lib/axios.ts`
- API endpoints and usage details are documented in the backend repo

## Live Demo

- Not available at the moment

## 4. Collaboration and Workflow

- **Version Control**: Git.
- **Branching Strategy**: Use feature-based branching.
- **Commit Messages**: Cursor should summarize changes and suggest commit messages for user review and editing. Do not auto-generate commit messages.

- **Terminal commands**: Always use either Git Bash on Windows or any Unix-based terminal; therefore, Cursor should default to Unix terminal commands and programs.

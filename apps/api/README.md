# Gdzie Jest Kosz – Backend

This repository contains the backend service for the mobile app that helps users (especially dog owners) locate nearby trash bins for pet waste disposal.

## Overview

- **Framework:** NestJS (TypeScript)
- **Database:** MySQL (via Prisma ORM)
- **Authentication:** Clerk
- **Geolocation:** Manages and serves geolocation data for bins

## Features

- User authentication and upsert via Clerk
- REST API for reporting and retrieving trash bins
- Geolocation-based bin search
- Modular, scalable codebase (feature-based modules)
- Integration and unit tests (Jest)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+ recommended)
- MySQL database
- Clerk account (for authentication)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

Push Prisma schema to database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Generate Prisma types:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Environment Setup

The application supports multiple environment files with automatic detection:

#### Environment File Priority (in order):

- **Development**: `.env.development` → `.env`
- **Test**: `.env.test` → `.env.test.local` → `.env`
- **Production**: `.env.production` → `.env.production.local` → `.env`

#### For Local Development:

Create a `.env` file (or `.env.development` for development-specific config):

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/dbname
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3220
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3223
```

#### For Production:

Use environment variables directly or create `.env.production`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@production.host:3306/dbname
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_production_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_production_secret
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3220
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Running the App

```bash
# development
npm run start

# watch mode (recommended for development)
npm run start:dev

# debug mode
npm run start:debug

# production
npm run start:prod
```

### Testing

```bash
# integration & unit tests
npm run test

# e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## API

- **/user/me** – Upserts and returns the current user (requires Clerk token)
- **/bins** – Get nearby bins (GET), report a new bin (POST, requires authentication)
- **/bins/admin** – Get nearby bins as admin (GET, requires admin role), create a new bin as admin (POST, requires admin role)
- **/bins/admin/:binId/location** – Update bin location as admin (PUT, requires admin role)

### Notes

- Endpoints under `/admin` require the user to have the `admin` role (authorization enforced by AdminGuard).
- CORS support: allowed origins can be configured via the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable.

## API Documentation (Swagger)

This project now includes interactive API documentation powered by [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), automatically generated from the codebase using NestJS decorators.

- **Access the docs:**
  - After starting the backend, visit: `http://localhost:3220/api` (or the port set in your environment)
  - The Swagger UI provides a browsable interface for all REST endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication requirements.
- **Authentication:**
  - Endpoints requiring authentication expect a valid Clerk JWT in the `Authorization` header (as a Bearer token). You can use the "Authorize" button in Swagger UI to provide your token for testing protected endpoints.
- **Versioning:**
  - The API is versioned (currently `v1`). All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/`.

**Note:** The Swagger docs are generated from code annotations using `@nestjs/swagger`. Keep these up to date as you add or modify endpoints.

## Error Handling & Response Format

All API errors are handled in a consistent, secure, and developer-friendly way.

### Standardized Error Responses

Every error response from the API follows this structure:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "path": "/api/v1/bins/123",
  "message": "Bin with ID 123 not found",
  "error": "Not Found"
}
```

- `statusCode`: HTTP status code
- `timestamp`: When the error occurred
- `path`: The endpoint that was called
- `message`: Human-readable error message (can be a string or array)
- `error`: Short error type (e.g., "Not Found", "Validation Error")

> **Note:** In development mode, you may also see a `details` field with stack traces or extra debug info. In production, this is never included for security.

### Custom Exceptions

The backend uses custom exception classes for domain-specific errors, such as:

- `BinNotFoundException`
- `InvalidLocationException`
- `BinAlreadyExistsException`
- `InsufficientPermissionsException`
- `MissingTokenException`
- `InvalidTokenException`
- ...and more

You can rely on both the `statusCode` and the `error` field to programmatically handle errors in your frontend/mobile app.

### Validation Errors

If you send invalid data, you'll get a `400 Bad Request` with a clear message about what went wrong.

### Security

Sensitive information (like stack traces or database error details) is **never** exposed in production error responses.

> For a full list of possible error responses and examples, see the [API Documentation (Swagger)](#api-documentation-swagger) section above.

## Project Structure

- `src/` – Source code (feature-based modules: bins, user, database, clerk)
- `prisma/` – Prisma schema and migrations
- `test/` – Integration and e2e tests

## Architecture Overview

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture and relationships between the main modules, services, and database entities in this backend.

```

Basically everything will use the Clerk Module to authorize user's actions on bins. TODO: introduce AuthModule that will handle authorization and make everything less coupled.

## Development Notes

- Code style: TypeScript, single quotes, semicolons mandatory
- Modular monolith architecture for scalability
- Focus on RESTful API best practices and efficient geolocation queries

## Authentication

Authentication is managed using [Clerk](https://clerk.com/). The backend verifies and manages users via Clerk tokens provided by the mobile app. Key points:

- All endpoints requiring authentication expect a valid Clerk JWT in the `Authorization` header (as a Bearer token).
- The `/user/me` endpoint upserts and returns the current user based on Clerk identity.
- Clerk integration is handled in the `src/clerk/` and `src/user/` modules, including guards and decorators for extracting and validating the current user.
- No user credentials are stored in the backend; all authentication and user management is delegated to Clerk.

## How Bin Search Distance Works

When you request nearby bins (as a user or admin), the backend determines which bins to return based on a **bounding box** around your provided latitude and longitude.

- **Bounding Box Delta:**  
  The search area is defined by a configurable delta (in degrees) for both latitude and longitude.
  - For both regular users and admins, this delta is currently set to `0.01` degrees (about ±1.1 km at the equator).
- **How it works:**
  - The backend fetches all bins where:
    ```
    latitude  >= (your_latitude  - 0.01)
    latitude  <= (your_latitude  + 0.01)
    longitude >= (your_longitude - 0.01)
    longitude <= (your_longitude + 0.01)
    ```
  - This forms a square search area centered on your location.
- **Configurable:**
  - The deltas are defined in `src/bins/bins.constants.ts` as `NEARBY_BINS_DELTA_USER` and `NEARBY_BINS_DELTA_ADMIN`.
  - You can easily adjust these values to make the search area larger or smaller for different user types.

> **Note:** This approach is fast and simple, but it's a square, not a true radius. For most use cases, it's accurate enough, but you can switch to a true radius/geospatial query if needed in the future.
